## ~~Reconciliation~~ Linking with SPARQL <a name="recon"></a>

In the [step 4 of the Assignment Day 1: Create RDF](ST_1.md#step4)
you used the interface of OntoRefine to reconcile the names of the cities against Wikidata data. 
Such services rely on matching literal values between resources of a particular type (e.g municipality of 
the Netherlands as in the [Assignment Day 1: Create RDF](ST_1.md)).
Same functionality can be achieved with SPARQL.
The query below does exactly the same but with LTB data. 
It tries to match labels of concepts from the LTB data and concepts from DBpedia. 
The query is annotated using `#` which allows providing human-readable comments that are 
invisible for the query processor. 

```SPARQL
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?sub ?label ?inDBpedia
{
# Part of the query that retrieves URIs and labels of concepts in LTB data
  
 ?sub a skos:Concept .
 ?sub rdfs:label ?label .
  
# Service part of thew query that will be executed by a remote endpoint (dbpedia)
  
  Service <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
    
# Part of the query that matches concepts from DBpedia (the first triple pattern: "?inDBpedia a skos:Concept ." ) 
#based on the literal values of their labels (the second triple pattern: "?inDBpedia rdfs:label ?label .")
    
    ?inDBpedia a skos:Concept .
    ?inDBpedia rdfs:label ?label .
    
  }
}
# notice a limit
LIMIT 1000
```

Copy the query and run it with YasGui. 


### Assignment 1: Accuracy of semantic integration <a name="ass1"></a>

Change the query below in such a way that it provides the greatest number of results with the 
most accurate semantic matching. In other words, you are asked to find such a combination of class declarations (can be more than one)
in line 9 (the commented out line) that yields the greatest number of semantically relevant results. 
 
```SPARQL
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?sub ?label ?dbcon
{
 ?sub a skos:Concept .
  ?sub rdfs:label ?label .
  Service <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
#   ?dbcon a skos:Concept .
    ?dbcon rdfs:label ?label .
  }
}
LIMIT 1000
```

- Assignment Day 2A: Choose 5 concepts from DBpedia that in your opinion have the best match. 
Add them to your LTB study area (create) and link them to matching concepts using relation "same as". 
To denote that those concept belong to DBpedia put ``DBpedia:` before the name of the concept and 
copy the concept URL into the "External resources" field in LTB.

- Assignment Day 2B: Add concepts that represent DBpedia classes used in the query. 
Link them to the 5 DBpedia concepts created in Assignment 1A using "is a kind of" relation.
