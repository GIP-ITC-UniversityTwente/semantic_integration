In this tutorial you will learn how to query Linked Data. 
[SPARQL](https://www.PAw3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) is the query language for the Semantic Web and Linked Data.
SPARQL is very expressive and capable of federated querying. The former allows constructing complex queries 
when the latter gives possibility to query more than one repository on runtime.
As a consequence, it is dead easy to make a query that crashes any repository. 
Therefore, make sure that your queries don't multiply everything by everything.
